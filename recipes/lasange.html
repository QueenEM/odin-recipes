    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef or Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can (28 ounces) crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 can (6 ounces) tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, and sauté until softened and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef or Italian sausage to the skillet, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the flavors meld together and the sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan cheese, egg, chopped parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping.</li>
        <li>Spread half of the cheese filling evenly over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Spoon half of the remaining meat sauce over the cheese filling, spreading it out evenly.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a layer of shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, cheese filling, meat sauce, and mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Finish with a final layer of noodles, meat sauce, and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. This allows the lasagna to set and makes it easier to slice.</li>
        <li>Slice the lasagna into squares and serve hot, garnished with additional fresh parsley if desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy the delicious homemade lasagna with your family and friends!</li>
