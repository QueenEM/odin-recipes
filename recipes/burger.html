    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A burger is a quintessential comfort food, beloved worldwide for its simplicity and versatility. At its core, a burger consists of a juicy patty made from ground beef, seasoned to perfection and cooked to your desired level of doneness. This savory masterpiece is then nestled between two halves of a soft, toasted hamburger bun, providing the perfect vessel for holding all the delicious toppings and condiments.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450g) ground beef (around 80% lean, 20% fat for juicy burgers)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional: seasoning such as garlic powder, onion powder, or Worcestershire sauce for extra flavor</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, season the ground beef with salt, pepper, and any additional seasonings or flavorings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Gently mix the seasonings into the ground beef, being careful not to overwork the meat, which can result in tough burgers.</li>
        <li>Divide the seasoned beef into equal portions and shape them into patties, slightly larger than the diameter of your hamburger buns. Press a slight indentation in the center of each patty to prevent them from puffing up during cooking.</li>
        <li>Preheat a grill, grill pan, or skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Place the burger patties onto the hot grill or skillet and cook for approximately 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare, or longer to your desired level of doneness.</li>
        <li>If adding cheese, place a slice of cheese on each patty during the last minute of cooking to allow it to melt.</li>
        <li>While the patties are cooking, prepare the burger fixings. Wash and dry the lettuce leaves, slice the tomatoes and onions, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a toaster until lightly golden brown.</li>
        <li>Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of each toasted hamburger bun.</li>
        <li>Top the lettuce with a cooked burger patty, followed by sliced tomatoes and onions.</li>
        <li>Add any additional condiments of your choice, such as ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise.</li>
        <li>Finish assembling the burgers by placing the top half of the toasted bun over the condiments.</li>
        <li>Serve the burgers immediately, alongside your choice of sides such as potato chips, fries, pickles, coleslaw, or salad.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your homemade burgers while they're hot and juicy!</li>
    </ol>
